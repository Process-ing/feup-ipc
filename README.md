## Description

This project focused on the development of the prototype of an application, related with the topic of "energy". Our application in specific, called "Watt Are You Doing?", is a web-based platform aimed at informing users about what their homes consume, providing insights and suggestions on how to save energy. 

In this course unit's project, we have continuously ideated our application, by specifying requirements and functionalities and developing both lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes, and compare it to user expectations, using user analysis and guidelines.

The project was divided into three phases:
- Phase I aimed at defining our application's idea, perform user questionnaires and PACT analysis, and define the platform's functionalities.
- Phase II focused on the definition of the main tasks, the development of the lo-fi prototype (wireframes) in Figma, and the heuristic evaluation.
- Phase III aimed at developing the hi-fi prototype in Figma, performing usability tests with Maze, and compiling our final results using statistical analysis.

## Tips and Tricks (for anyone doing a similar project)

- When writing the user questionnaires for the first phase, remember that the questions must provide all the necessary data for the PACT analysis. This will require to do a "pre-analysis" when creating the forms (match each form question to parts of the PACT).
- Do not forget that you are supposed to have the prototypes done on the class prior to the one of the respective presentation (for phases II and III), so don't leave it to the last minute!
- Do not be afraid of using multiple plugins and libraries for the prototypes in Figma, such as component libraries. We used [Paper Kit](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1075811850250564922) for the wireframes, and we relied heavily on [Untitled UI](https://www.untitledui.com/) components and other libraries for the final prototype.
